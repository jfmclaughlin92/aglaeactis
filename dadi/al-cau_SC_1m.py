# Needs to be bigger than the number of samples you have (n>ns) and this will be a strong determination as to how long your program will run.

#    Split into two populations of specifed size, with migration.
#    nu1: Size of population 1 after split.
#    nu2: Size of population 2 after split.
#    T: Time in the past of split (in units of 2*Na generations) 
#    m: Migration rate between populations (2*Na*m)

#    pts: Number of grid points to use in integration.

# The upper_bound and lower_bound lists are for use in optimization.

# want to exclude values with very long times, very small population sizes, or
# very high migration rates, as they will take a long time to evaluate.
# Parameters are: (nu1,nu2,T,m)

#Set the upper and lower bounds to make sure that the bounderies are

#parameters: lower 0, upper 10,size parameters: lower 1e-2, upper 100
